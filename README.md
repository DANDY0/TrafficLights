# Traffic Light Logic (Test Task)

This is a small Unity project built as part of a test assignment.

The task involved implementing the logic for a system of two interdependent traffic lights and a simple UI that reacts to the light state.

## Features

- 4-phase traffic light logic (Red, Red/Amber, Amber, Green)
- Signal timing is configurable via ScriptableObject
- Lights are synchronized to simulate an intersection
- UI displays "Can drive" / "Can't drive" depending on the light and player position
- Modular and extendable code structure
- No third-party packages used
